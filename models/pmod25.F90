! Description of data structure
!
! For all elements, species and phases there are two arrays defined.
! The first (data) array contains the elements species etc and all their data
! in the order they were entered and the data are never moved.
! The second (index) array contain the elements, species etc in alphabetical 
! (or whatever) order and is updated whenever a new element, species etc 
! is added. This array is an integer array with the index of the data array.
! Most links inside the different records to elements, species etc
! are indices to the data array which is never changed.  
! TPFUNS used in parameters are also stored in an array and the index
! to this array is stored in the property record to specify the function.
!
! For parameters inside each phase record there is one (or 2 if disordered set)
! lists with endmember parameters.  Each endmember record can be the root
! of a binary tree with interaction parameters.  Each of these records
! can have a property list with various data like G, TC, MQ etc.  These
! records are created dynamically and can only be found by following the links.
!
! Each phase has one or more composition sets.  These are part of the
! equilibrium data structure which also contains conditions, calculated
! values of TP functions and other symbols.
!
! An equilibrium record has been introduced.  One such record is created
! in init_gtp and it is called FIRSTEQ which is a global variable.
! There is also an array EQLISTA which should contain all allocated
! equilibrium records, FIRSTEQ is a pointer to the first element in this array.
! More equilibrium records can be initiated by enter_equilibrium subroutine.
! This copies the relevant data from FIRSTEQ.
! After a second equilibrium is created it is forbidden to enter elements,
! species? or phases and create additional fraction sets, i.e. one must
! not change the data structure except to add/remove composition sets
! (but not implemented yet for multiple equilibria).  Composition sets must be
! created in all equilibrium records at the same time (if done in a thread
! then all threads must stop while this is done).  During step/map calculation
! each calculated equilibria is saved for later use in plotting och other
! postprocessing.  These saved equilibria may have different number of
! composition sets so great care must be taken using them.
!
! The equilibrium data record is "stand alone" and contains all necessary
! data to describe the equilibrium (except the model parameters and other
! static data).  In parallel processing each thread will have its own
! equilibrium data record.
!
! The intention is that several equilibra can be created both to store 
! individual experimental data in assessments and for each thread in parallel.
! In the equilibrium record there are conditions, components (with chemical
! potentials) and an error code and most important, the phase_varres record
! array with one or more record for each phase.  This array must be identical
! in all equilibria recods.  Each composition set has a phase_varres record
! and they are linked from the phase record by the LIKTOCS array.  As the
! phase_varres records are in an array the link is simply an integer index of
! this array.  There is a free list inside the phase_varres array to be used
! when adding or removing a composition set.
! >>> NOT DONE: when composition sets are created they must be
!               created in all equilibrium records at the same time.
! The EQ_TPRES array is declared inside the equilibrium record.
! The index to a function in EQ_TPRES is the same as the index to the TPFUN
! array declared globally in TPFUN.  The TPFUN array has the actual expression,
! and EQ_TPRES has the last calculated results, which can be different in each
! equilibrium.  The TPFUN index is used in property records to specify
! the function of a parameter.
! 
! In many subroutines the equilibrium record called CEQ (Current EQilibrium)
! is an argument which means it operates on the data in that 
! equilibrium record only.
!
! In the record array PHASE_VARRES (including disordered) each phase 
! and composition set has a record.  If no parallel calculation and no
! experiments the equilibrium record FIRSTEQ is enough.
!
! In programming for parallel processing THREADPRIVATE
! should be avoided as it usually has a very slow implementation.
!
! Some routines exist both with and without the CEQ argument.  A programmer
! can create his own array of equilibrium data records and use any of
! them in such calls. ???? Maybe not, then how to update when a new
! composition set is needed???
!
! Thread specific data are needed for conditions, phase status, constitution,
! function values and calc results like G and derivatives for each phase,
! amounts of phases etc.  When calling a subroutine to get mole frations etc 
! the equilibrium record CEQ must be supplied.
!
! The global error code is defined in tpfunlib, that is not very good.  There
! must be an error code specific to each equilibrium.  Or can one declare
! the error code as "local" to the thread?
!
  use iso_c_binding
! routines for inverting matrix etc
  use lukasnum
! TP functions, tpfunlib makes USE of metlib
  use tpfunlib
! for parallel processing, not used yet
!  use OMP_LIB
!
!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! To be added or fixed (in no special order, * means priority):
!  - *reference states for G, H, MU etc
!  - volume model
!  - parameter permutations for ordering (option B, done for F)
!  - *dot derivatives
!  - consistent units conversion between user/software (C/F/K,cal/BTU/eV/J etc)
!  - reciprocal composition dependent parameters
!  - HSS corrected quasichemical liquid model
!  - multicomponent CVM tetrahedron fcc model
!  - *other components than the elements
!  - wildcards in state variables (like show x(*), partially done)
!  - Implement SER phase data.  When calculating with the SER phase one must
!    have different magnetic models for different elements !!
!  - amend_data for elements, species, phases, symbols
!  - more symbols (variables, value-functions, PUTFUN functions, coefficients)
!  - New magnetic model (Wei)
!  - New heat capacity models (from 0 K)
!  - Enable that state variables functions can call TP functions
!  - Improve the grid for gridminimization
!  - *find out how to handle the error code in parallel processing
!  - *save/read of data using random access file
!  - parallellisation
!  - Modify gcalc so one can calcule just a single property like the mobility
!  - write TDB files
